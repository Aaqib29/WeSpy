# What is C2 ?
* Command and Control Infrastructure, also known as C2 or C&C.
* It is a device or machine under the control of a cybercriminal.
* An attacker uses a command-and-control server to maintain communications with and remotely control malware or malicious scripts within a target network.
* A command-and-control server can be likened to the puppeteer who controls the puppets in a show. The puppetsâ€™ actions depend on the instructions issued by the command-and-control server.
